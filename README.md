### Hi there, I'm Johnny ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program and will be finished by December 2022. I come from an engineering background, but I transitioned into the computing field because I love computers and technology and I enjoy problem solving. I really enjoy front-end development as I believe it complements by knack for design and attention to detail. 

In my free time, I am usually picking up books or comics, or exercising. Big enthusiast of Korean/Japanese/Chinese culture.
