### Hi there, I'm Johnny ğŸ‘‹

**jryue/jryue** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am currently a student at BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program. I come from an engineering background, but I transitioned into the computing field because I love computers and technology and I enjoy problem solving. Some of my interests include: the advancement of green energies/technologies, learning about other cultures and keeping myself up to date on global current events, and enjoying team-based video games. In my free time, I enjoy reading crime/mystery novels and I make an effort to contribute to my community by getting involved with youth programs at my church or partaking in community clean-ups.
